# Introdoction

Shifting from "developing a piece of software" to "designing an educational ecosystem" means that you are not merely creating a tool, but redefining the very concept of "learning".
To build a system that enables interdisciplinary integration, joyful learning and diverse evaluation, we need to draw on the core concepts of PBL (Project-Based Learning), Finland’s Phenomenon-based Learning and STEAM education.

从“开发一个软件”转向“设计一种教育生态”，这意味着您不仅仅是在做一个工具，而是在重新定义“学习”这件事。
要实现跨学科融合、快乐学习且非单一评价的体系，我们需要参考PBL（项目制学习）、芬兰现象式教学（Phenomenon-based Learning）以及STEAM教育的核心理念。

Each parent & teacher should consider more that knowledge itself, let focus on how children grow up, help them to develop their capabilities to find question, define issue, research solution and make it haapen!

每位家长和老师都应该考虑的不仅仅是知识本身，还要关注孩子的成长，帮助他们培养发现问题、定义问题、研究解决方案并使其实现的能力
